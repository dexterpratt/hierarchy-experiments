These networks have the problem that they are not processed to map orthologs across species. I need to treat them as a set of datasets, inventory them for utility, decide a strategy for integration and use.

**RTC host proteins** by proximity labeling[(V'kovski et al. 2019)](https://paperpile.com/c/IoHJjF/GVkx)

The data was generated in mouse cells.

They also determined the RTC host proteins with the most impact on viral replication but whic were not essential for survival in non-infected cells.
